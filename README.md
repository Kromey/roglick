Ro'glick
========

A skill-based Rogue-like game.

Running Ro'glick
----------------

Ro'glick is written for Python 3 (tested on 3.4, but will probably be fine on
3.3, maybe even 3.2); assuming you have Python 3 installed, you can simply run
roglick.py to play the game -- there are no additional external dependencies.
