Ro'glick
========

A skill-based Rogue-like game.

Running Ro'glick
----------------

Ro'glick is written for Python 3 (tested on 3.4, but will probably be fine on
3.3, maybe even 3.2); assuming you have Python 3 installed, you can simply run
roglick.py to play the game -- there are no additional external dependencies.

Playing the Game
----------------

To play the game, simply run roglick.py. You are the white @, and you're
exploring an infinitely deep dungeon. Movement is with the keypad, or with the
classic Rogue-style keys: hjkl move you left, down, up, or right, respectively,
while yubn are for diagonal movement.

When you find a staircase (> leads deeper into the dungeon, while < takes you
back up to the previous level), > will descend a downward stairscase, while <
will ascend.

The ESC key will quit the game.
